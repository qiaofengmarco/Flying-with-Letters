## Control:
- WASD(or Arrow Keys): Moving the Dragon
- SPACE: Launch fireballs (You won't get any bonus if the fireballs hit some letters.)

## Rules:
1. Eat: If the Dragon impact a letter, the letter will be counted and a spelling process begins. Plus, if you spell the word right, you will get points equalling to 5 muliplying the length of the word spelt. 
2. Bomb: If the Dragon impact a bomb or a fireball hit a bomb, the spelling bar and the letters on the screen will be cleared. 

## Additional Tipsï¼š
1. The portal of codes (i.e. main function) is in GameFrame.java. 
2. GameFrame.java is the main UI design file, GamePanel.java is the main game panel.
3. And because the game comes from a small part of my final project, so few words are added: apple, bananas, bad, cat, bob, flying, god, dad, f-word.
