## Control:
- WASD(or Arrow Keys): Moving the Dragon
- SPACE: Launch fireballs

## Rules:
1. Get 10 if a fireball hit a letter.
2. Eat: If the Dragon hits a letter, the letter will be counted and a spelling process begins. Plus, if you spell the word right, you will get points equalling to 5 muliplying the length of the word spelt. 

## Additonal Tipsï¼š
1. .jar file can be executed in Windows.
2. GameFrame.java is the main UI design file, GamePanel.java is the main game panel.
3. And because the game comes from a small part of my final project, so few words are added: apple, bananas, bad, cat, bob, flying, god, dad, f-word.

## Update at 2017.6.21:
